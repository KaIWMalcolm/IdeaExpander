    <h2>Why We Built It</h2>
    <p>
        The inspiration for Idea Expander came from recognizing how often people get stuck 
        during the creative process. Many existing tools are overly complex, hard to navigate, 
        or tailored for businesses rather than individuals. We wanted to build a simple, 
        responsive, and accessible platform that anyone could use, no matter their background.
    </p>
    <p>
        With Idea Expander, you don’t need to worry about categorizing your thoughts or breaking 
        them down into predefined formats. Just type in what’s on your mind, select the style 
        you prefer, and let AI work its magic.
    </p>
